🔐 SmartCard Security Project – TUM SmartCard Lab

This repository documents the implementation and evaluation of secure SmartCard communication, conducted as part of the SmartCard Lab at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). The project was completed in collaboration with Sevan and focused on analyzing protocol-level vulnerabilities and reinforcing the system against physical and logical attacks.

🧩 Part 1 – Communication Setup & Protocol Analysis

The first phase focused on establishing a working SmartCard communication stack based on ISO/IEC 7816-3 and the T=0 protocol. This involved building the foundational firmware and host interface to support structured data exchange between a terminal and the SmartCard.

🔧 Key Components:
	•	USART initialization for ISO 7816-3-compliant asynchronous communication
	•	Implementation of the T=0 character-level protocol
	•	Handling of APDU command parsing and response formatting
	•	Logging and visualization of command exchanges using logic analyzers

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:
	•	STM32 microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M)
	•	Low-level C firmware
	•	Hardware debugging tools (logic analyzer, serial monitor)

🎯 Part 2 – Side-Channel Attack & Countermeasures

In the second phase, the focus shifted to security evaluation through Differential Power Analysis (DPA) and countermeasure implementation.

🧪 Attack Execution:
	•	Collected power traces during AES execution
	•	Analyzed data leakage patterns from intermediate rounds
	•	Demonstrated potential key recovery under unprotected conditions

🔐 Hardening Techniques:
	•	Introduced masking and shuffling countermeasures in AES S-box operations
	•	Measured and compared power trace uniformity before and after protection
	•	Evaluated the performance-security trade-off of implemented defenses

⸻

📈 Outcomes
	•	Established secure, ISO-compliant SmartCard communication from scratch
	•	Demonstrated the feasibility of DPA attacks on embedded crypto implementations
	•	Successfully implemented and validated lightweight software-level defenses
